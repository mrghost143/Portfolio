    //   My interest in web development started back in 2021  when I decided to try
    //   editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot  about HTML & CSS!

    // <p key="2">Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency,
    //   a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
    //   accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at <UnderHightlight onClick={() => console.log("helo")}>
    //     Neosoft
    //   </UnderHightlight > for a variety of clients.
